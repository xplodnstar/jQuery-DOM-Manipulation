            <h3>Edward Elric</h3>
            <div class="fold">
                <p>Edward was born in a small town named Resembool in the nation of Amestris, living with his younger
                    brother Alphonse and their parents Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim. After Hohenheim left the family
                    on a
                    journey early in their lives, Edward developed a loathing for their father as he and Alphonse
                    learned to
                    use alchemy before Trisha died of an illness years later. Thee two young boys concentrated on
                    studying alchemy in the hopes of bringing their mother back to life, and trained with a skilled
                    alchemist named Izumi Curtis.When they make the attempt to revive their mother, it failed and the
                    brothers paid a bigger price via the Law of Equivalent Exchange: which states that every outcome
                    requires an equal payment.

            <h3>Alphonse Elric</h3>
            <div class="fold">
                <p>Alphonse loses his entire body while he and Edward are trying to revive his mother Trisha using
                    alchemy.
                    Edward sacrifices his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor. Edward later becomes
                    an
                    alchemist from the state military of Amestris, and starts traveling with Alphonse to search for a
                    method
                    to recover Alphonse's body. They seek the Philosopher's Stone, which would allow them to restore
                    their
                    physical forms. Besides being a powerful alchemist, Alphonse is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter;
                    having
                    been trained by Izumi Curtis. While Alphonse cannot feel anything because he has no body, he is
                    nearly
                    invincible as long as the blood mark made by Edward on his armor to contain his soul is not defaced.

            <h3>Winry Rockbell</h3>
            <div class="fold">
                <p>Winry has known Edward and Alphonse since childhood. She was orphaned at a young age when her parents
                    were killed while serving as doctors in the Ishvalan war. She lived with her grandmother in
                    Resembool
                    from then on. Known as an "Automail Otaku", she is fascinated by any and all types of machines,
                    tools,
                    and excels in building and repairing automail. Along with her grandmother, Pinako, also a famous
                    automail engineer, the two run a small shop out of their home. Winry is known to be an aoutomail
                    prodigy. They made and installed Edward's automail arm and leg after he lost his original limbs in a
                    failed human transmutation of his mother. Winry takes it upon herself to make sure that his automail
                    is
                    in top form, and travels to service it when as needed.[This dedication is either out of enthusiasm
                    (due
                    to these moments making up most of the moments she gets to be with Edward and Alphonse, as well as
                    getting paid for each) or out of frustration (due to Edward constantly breaking his automail, which
                    she
                    is worried as to how Edward breaks the arm and what dangerous situations he is put in).</p>
